# To trigger customizations during easybuild

##  reference_database_path

This trigger is to inject the location of the reference data 
location to the module file. When this is triggered something
like the following will be included in the module file

```
if mode() == "load" then
io.stderr:write([==[Database_location=/cluster/shared/databases/blast/latest]==])
end
```

### How to decide which module to update with what ?
For each module file that needs this update, a file should be
created with the exact name of the module in the following location

/cluster/shared/databases/module-trigers

example file:
```
cat /cluster/shared/databases/module-trigers/BLAST+ 

#Sabryr 14-06-2021
#Database location

Database_location=/cluster/shared/databases/blast/latest
```

### How do I trigger this trigger ?

Ideally the following should be included in the module files
for BuildEnv, so nothing extra needed.

In the file
/cluster/modulefiles/Core/BuildEnv.lua 

setenv("EASYBUILD_HOOKS", "/cluster/installations/easybuild/hooks/saga_eb_hooks.py")

Untill that is finalized, use
--hooks /cluster/installations/easybuild/hooks/saga_eb_hooks.py 

Example to install blast+
To install new module
```
 eb --hooks /cluster/installations/easybuild/hooks/saga_eb_hooks.py --robot  BLAST+-2.11.0-gompi-2020b.eb
```

To modify existing module
```
 eb --hooks /cluster/installations/easybuild/hooks/saga_eb_hooks.py --force --robot  BLAST+-2.11.0-gompi-2020b.eb
```
